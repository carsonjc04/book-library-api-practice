Book Directory API

This project was created to experiment with simple HTTP API calls and to showcase basic Node.js + Express patterns.

What it demonstrates:
- Simple CRUD routes for managing books
- JSON request/response handling and status codes
- A minimal server setup for local testing

Run:
```
node server.js
```

That's it — a small sandbox for practicing API work.
